# Members Only!

This project was created to practice <strong>authenticating users</strong> using <strong>Devise</strong> while also practicing <strong>CRUD</strong> actions.

### The Assignment From The Odin Project

"In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. <strong>Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it</strong>."

### Functionality

* Logged in users can create their own posts
* The author of each post is <strong>hidden</strong> unless the user is <strong>authenticated</strong> and logged in.
* User sessions (log in and out) handled with <strong>Devise</strong>
* User registration (sign up) handled with <strong>Devise</strong>
* <strong>Bootstrap</strong> used for styling
