This project was created to practice authenticating users using Devise while also practicing CRUD actions.

### The Assignment From The Odin Project

"In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it."
